# Laminos.py

Readme by Attrainon..

Wellcome gay & girl, As many people know, recently everyone faced a shutdown of bots by Team Amino.  We will make some changes to the existence of 1.2.17 and re-release our amino share in a remaster.  Let's start !!

As everyone already knows, to install the lib, you need to register a command. pip install amino.py

Installation of this lib is quite simple!  To do this, you just need to write "pip install Laminos"

Completely!
